The one thing each can agree on is their love for the city, Nick, a third generation Italian-American whose love for the city is partly from the immigrant experience of his maternal \"nonna\", Gia. Beyond the auction house party, Tracy and Nick begin to bond in each helping the other with a prominent work issue: Tracy trying to find a museum to purchase an original handwritten draft of Emma Lazarus' \"The New Colussus\" made most famous by being engraved on the Statue of Liberty, it going to auction which would probably mean it being purchased by private buyer Carter Wainwright who would otherwise hide it in a vault, and Nick opening a new Asian-Italian fusion restaurant against Nonna's traditional Italian sensibilities. The question becomes whether romance-shy Tracy will be open enough to let Nick romantically into her life, especially so soon after Finn. —Huggo","yt_trailer_code":"fYIGy0W1w50","language":"en","mpa_rating":"","background_image":"https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/the_wedding_veil_legacy_2022/background.jpg","background_image_original":"https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/the_wedding_veil_legacy_2022/background.jpg","small_cover_image":"https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/the_wedding_veil_legacy_2022/small-cover.jpg","medium_cover_image":"https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/the_wedding_veil_legacy_2022/medium-cover.jpg","large_cover_image":"https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/the_wedding_veil_legacy_2022/large-cover.jpg","state":"ok","torrents":[{"url":"https://yts.mx/torrent/download/843F5C4C4E9A8F6C691F2D07FA4D5D0F5718E2A4","hash":"843F5C4C4E9A8F6C691F2D07FA4D5D0F5718E2A4","quality":"720p","type":"web","seeds":193,"peers":70,"size":"774.43 MB","size_bytes":812048712,"date_uploaded":"2022-02-21 10:45:19","date_uploaded_unix":1645436719},{"url":"https://yts.mx/torrent/download/C1C6652EBC1112D29E0AFB7049385F2BF9BC0920","hash":"C1C6652EBC1112D29E0AFB7049385F2BF9BC0920","quality":"1080p","type":"web","seeds":135,"peers":79,"size":"1.55 GB","size_bytes":1664299827,"date_uploaded":"2022-02-21 11:51:06","date_uploaded_unix":1645440666}],"date_uploaded":"2022-02-21 10:45:19","date_uploaded_unix":1645436719},{"id":40179,"url":"https://yts.mx/movies/man-with-the-screaming-brain-2005","imdb_code":"tt0365478","title":"Man with the Screaming Brain","title_english":"Man with the Screaming Brain","title_long":"Man with the Screaming Brain (2005)","slug":"man-with-the-screaming-brain-2005","year":2005,"rating":5.5,"runtime":90,"genres":["Comedy","Family","Fantasy"],"summary":"Man with the Screaming Brain is a story of greed, betrayal and revenge in a small Bulgarian town.
